- Image name/tag tells us where it is located in registry.  

## Image address 

` docker.io/erkansirin78/merhabajava:latest `  

- `docker.io` -> url this is default url  

- `erkansirin78/merhabajava` -> repository/name 
 
- `latest` -> tag latest is default tag  

- `latest` tag doesn't mean image is the latest version of that app.  

## Docker hub menu  
Docker, Containers, Plugins  

- If an image name doesn't contain **/** that means image is official docker image.  

# Docker file instructions 

## FROM 
- The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction

- example:
`FROM centos:7`  

## RUN
- The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

- use `\` to continue new line  

- example: 
```
RUN yum install epel-release -y && \
    yum update -y


RUN /bin/bash -c 'source $HOME/.bashrc; echo $HOME'

or

RUN ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo hello"]
```

## CMD  
- The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.   
- There can only be **one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile.**  
- Do not confuse RUN with CMD. RUN actually runs a command and commits the result; CMD does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended command for the image.
- We can change cmd command while executing docker run command.
- RUN for building, CMD for running

## ENV
- `ENV <key>=<value>`  

- example:
```
ENV JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk/"
ENV SPARK_HOME="/opt/manual/spark/"
```

- You can learn which env variables are available from repository documentation page.

## ADD
- The ADD instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path `<dest>`.  

## COPY
- The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.

Multiple <src> resources may be specified but the paths of files and directories will be interpreted as relative to the source of the context of the build.

## ADD vs. COPY (Always use COPY, unless you have to use ADD)
-------------------------
The major difference is that ADD can do more than COPY:
- ADD allows `<src>` to be an URL
- ADD can extract tar and zipped files 
- **COPY suggested:** using COPY where the magic of ADD is not required. Otherwise, you (since you had to look up this answer) are likely to get surprised someday when you mean to copy keep_this_archive_intact.tar.gz into your container, but instead, you spray the contents onto your filesystem.

## ENTRYPOINT
- It is like CMD but we cannot change ENTRYPOINT  while executing docker run command.
- Every docker image must have **at least one CMD or ENTRYPOINT**. Both can be use at the same time.
- If you use both Docker will consider CMD as an argument of ENTRYPOINT  





## ENTRYPOINT vs CMD 
-------------------------------
Each image will be either CMD or ENTRYPOINT (at least one of them)
ENTRYPOINT can not be changed at runtime, but the CMD may change.
CMD becomes parameter to ENTRYPOINT if ENTRYPOINT and CMD are used together
For example, if ENTRYPOINT is ping, CMD will be ip address. 

- Example
DockerfileAlpinePinger
```
FROM alpine

ENTRYPOINT ["ping"]

CMD ["google.com"]
```

-  Build  
` docker build -t erkansirin78/alpine-ping:atscale5 -f DockerfileAlpinePinger . `

- Run
```
docker run --rm erkansirin78/alpine-ping:atscale5 -c 3 google.com


PING google.com (216.58.214.142): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 216.58.214.142: seq=0 ttl=115 time=24.821 ms
64 bytes from 216.58.214.142: seq=1 ttl=115 time=21.114 ms
64 bytes from 216.58.214.142: seq=2 ttl=115 time=22.260 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 21.114/22.731/24.821 ms
```


## EXEC AND SHELL FORM
- **Exec** form is in json array  
`CMD["echo","Hello world"]`  

- **Shell** form  
`CMD echo "Hello World" `  

Shell form runs the command on a shell inside docker. So it can read variables.  

Exec for runs the command as process so it cannot read variables.

If you use ENTRYPOINT and CMD together you cannot use Shell form. In this case you must use exec form.
